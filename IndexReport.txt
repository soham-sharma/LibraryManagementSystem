1. Index on Books (book_id)

This index would speed up the following queries:

- "UPDATE Books SET title = %s, author_id = %s, genre_id = %s, publisher_id = %s, published_date = %s WHERE book_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `book_id` column, so an index on `book_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific book to update.
- "DELETE FROM Books WHERE book_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `book_id` column, so an index on `book_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific book to delete.
- "SELECT b.title, a.name, g.genre_name, p.publisher_name, b.published_date "
"FROM Books b "
"JOIN Authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id "
"JOIN Genres g ON b.genre_id = g.genre_id "
"JOIN Publishers p ON b.publisher_id = p.publisher_id "
"WHERE b.book_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `book_id` column, so an index on `book_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific book details.
- "SELECT title FROM Books WHERE book_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `book_id` column, so an index on `book_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific book title.


2. Index on Borrowers (borrower_id)

This index would speed up the following queries:

- "SELECT name, phone_number FROM Borrowers WHERE borrower_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `borrower_id` column, so an index on `borrower_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific borrower details.
- "UPDATE Borrowers SET name = %s, phone_number = %s WHERE borrower_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `borrower_id` column, so an index on `borrower_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific borrower to update.
- "DELETE FROM Borrowers WHERE borrower_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `borrower_id` column, so an index on `borrower_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific borrower to delete.
- "SELECT name FROM Borrowers WHERE borrower_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `borrower_id` column, so an index on `borrower_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific borrower name.


3. Index on BookCopies (copy_id, book_id)

This index would speed up the following queries:

- "SELECT bc.copy_id, bc.book_id "
                       "FROM BookCopies bc "
                       "JOIN Borrowings b ON bc.copy_id = b.copy_id AND bc.book_id = b.book_id "
This query has a JOIN condition on the `copy_id` and `book_id` columns, so an index on these columns would speed up the join operation.
- "DELETE FROM BookCopies WHERE book_id = %s AND copy_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `book_id` and `copy_id` columns, so an index on these columns would speed up the lookup of the specific book copy to delete.

4. Index on Genres (genre_id)

This index would speed up the following queries:

- "SELECT genre_name FROM Genres WHERE genre_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `genre_id` column, so an index on `genre_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific genre name.
- "UPDATE Genres SET genre_name = %s WHERE genre_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `genre_id` column, so an index on `genre_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific genre to update.
- "DELETE FROM Genres WHERE genre_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `genre_id` column, so an index on `genre_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific genre to delete.

5. Index on Publishers (publisher_id)

This index would speed up the following queries:

- "SELECT publisher_name FROM Publishers WHERE publisher_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `publisher_id` column, so an index on `publisher_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific publisher name.
- "UPDATE Publishers SET publisher_name = %s WHERE publisher_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `publisher_id` column, so an index on `publisher_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific publisher to update.
- "DELETE FROM Publishers WHERE publisher_id = %s"
This query has a WHERE clause on the `publisher_id` column, so an index on `publisher_id` would speed up the lookup of the specific publisher to delete.


Overall, adding these indexes would improve the performance of the queries mentioned above by
